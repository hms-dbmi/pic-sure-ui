PIC-SURE API UI Extension
=========================

The archetype that generated this project allows you to customize common
functionality and styling of the PIC-SURE UI project.

The PIC-SURE UI base project can be seen here:

https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-ui

To run your local development environment you will need the following:

Maven 3+
A recent Docker installation including docker-compose

Running in Dev Mode
-------------------

mvn clean install       # this retrieves dependencies
docker-compose up -d    # this starts an apache httpd server that hosts the app

You can then point your browser at your docker node. You might be using
docker-machine, you might not this is dependent on your environment. 

Once the app is running, you can edit the files in src/main/javascript
and src/main/resources and just refresh your browser to see the changes.


Minor Changes
-------------

If you just want to change the color scheme or how counts are displayed
or anything really common like that, you can probably just edit the files
in src/main/javascript/overrides. Each of these files has some comments
about how to edit them properly at the top.


Major Changes
-------------

If you want to completely override something or the standard overrides
don't account for your use-case, you can override entire modules by editing
src/main/javascript/overrides/main.js to override the path of a module
to point to your overridden version. Keep in mind this means you should
be implementing everything in the API exposed by the original module.


What Next
---------

If your changes are applicable to the general use-cases for PIC-SURE UI
we might want to integrate them into the base project. Also, if you believe
we could better serve the community by adding more default extension points
