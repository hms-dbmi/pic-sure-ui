Instructions to launch in dev mode:

Prerequisites: Maven 3+, Java, Docker and docker-compose

mvn clean install && docker-compose build && docker-compose up -d

If you make source code changes, just re-run the same command and 
it will redeploy the stack for you.

This was changed from the much shorter maven based deployment to 
resolve a certificate issue with grin-docker-dev. Once the cert
issue is resolved the maven tomcat configs will work again.
